# Leetcode-Problems
My code for programming problems out there in internet

## Pattern Problem (in C)
Contains code for printing different patterns using asterisks, numbers and alphabets. I've tried to make the code close to O(n) time complexity. The problems for the code came from takeuforward.org [https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/must-do-pattern-problems-before-starting-dsa/] DSA sheet.
